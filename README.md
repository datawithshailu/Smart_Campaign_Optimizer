# 📊 Smart Campaign Optimizer – Python Project

### 🎯 Objective  
Analyze marketing campaign data to discover which customer segments, product types, and campaign strategies drive the highest success — and use machine learning to predict future campaign performance.

---

### 📁 Dataset Overview  
The dataset includes 100 records with the following features:
- `User_ID` – Unique user identifier  
- `Age_Group` – Age range (e.g., 18-25, 26-35)  
- `Region` – Geographic region (North, South, East, West)  
- `Purchase_Hour` – Time of the day  
- `Product_Category` – Type of product (Electronics, Beauty, etc.)  
- `Campaign_Type` – Festive, Discount, Launch  
- `Campaign_Success` – Yes/No (whether the campaign succeeded)

---

### 🧠 Skills Used
- Python  
- Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn (Label Encoding, Logistic Regression, Evaluation Metrics)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- GitHub

---

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Used `seaborn` and `matplotlib` to visualize:
- ✅ Campaign success by **Age Group**, **Region**, **Product**, and **Campaign Type**
- ✅ Identified top-performing segments (e.g., Age 36–45, East Region)
- ✅ Insights guided data-driven targeting strategies

---

### 🤖 Machine Learning
- ✅ Cleaned and encoded categorical variables using `LabelEncoder`
- ✅ Trained a **Logistic Regression** model to predict campaign success
- ✅ Evaluated using:
  - Accuracy Score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report  
- Achieved **[your accuracy]%** on test data  
  *(update this after seeing the model output)*

---

### 💡 Key Business Insights
- **East region** and **Launch campaigns** perform best
- Age group **36–45** shows higher success rates
- Prediction model can help improve targeting and reduce campaign waste
